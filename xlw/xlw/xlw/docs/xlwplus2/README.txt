This directory contains the documentation for xlw version 2, including the InterfaceGenerator utility.

To create the documentation under Linux, type 'make'.  It is also possible to generate the documentation under Windows but no build environment is maintained for that platform.

The Linux build creates file xlwplus2.pdf, and generates the doc in html format in subdirectories html-singlepage and html-multipage.  Directory html-singlepage should be kept in synch with directory version2 on the website.
