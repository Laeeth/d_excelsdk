\section conv_vernum Version Numbers

The convention for XLW version numbers is xx.yy.zzsn where:

xx is the major number \n
yy is the minor number \n
zz is the minor-minor number \n
s  is a letter indicating the status of the release - a(lpha), b(eta), or f(inal) \n
n  is an ordinal number \n

The corresponding branch in the subversion repository is named
Rxxyyzzsn-branch, where R stands for release.  For example, here is the link
to the branch in the subversion repository that corresponds to XLW release
2.0.0f0:

<a href="http://xlw.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xlw/branches/R020000f0-branch/"  target="_blank">http://xlw.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xlw/branches/R020000f0-branch/</a>

\section conv_binaries Binary Names

When XLW is compiled, the resulting binaries - lib files and XLLs - are named
according to the conventions specified by the boost project:

<a href="http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html#library-naming">http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html#library-naming</a>

For example, when you compile XLW version 3.0.0 using VC9 solution file
xlw/build/vc9/xlw.sln, the output file is xlw/lib/xlw-vc90-mt-3_0_0.lib.
