With 2005 you must tell the compiler where the Windows SDK directories are, the easiest way of doing this is start Visual C++ and
go to.

From the Tools menu in Visual Studio, select Options. The Options dialog box appears.

From the Options dialog box, expand the Projects and Solutions node and select VC++ Directories. In that section, add the following paths as the last item in the appropriate subsection:

- Executable files: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\v7.1\\Bin
- Include files: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\v7.1\\include
- Library files: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\v7.1\\lib

\section tweaks Tweaking Visual Studio Express
	
The default install of Visual Studio ( C++, C# or VisualBasic) does not show the
  the build configuration at the top as is the case for the Professional Edition.
    This can be changed by going to Tools->Options then checking the box 'Show All Settings'.
    Then from the menu in the list on the left select 'Projects and Solutions -> General'
    then check boxes "Show advanced build configurations' and 
    'Show Output window when build starts'
