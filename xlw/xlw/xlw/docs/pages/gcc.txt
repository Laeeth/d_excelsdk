\section summary Summary


\subsection required Required Software

The prebuilt libraries were built with GCC 4.5.2.

There are 2 supported ways of installing MinGW with gcc 4.5.2 for use with Xlw:

- <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/" target="_blank">The MinGW Automated Installer</a> - Get the most recent installer and install the C++ compiler and the MinGW developer toolkit.

- <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xlw/files/xlw-mingw-installer/MINGW_GCC4.5.2-1/" target="_blank">The Xlw MinGw Installer</a>

Either method of installing MingW should be fine and install the necessary tools to compile xlls with gcc. The installation resulting from the xlw installer is more regularly testedby the development team.

\subsection other Using Other Versions of gcc

If you are not using one of the install methods mentioned above then it may be possible to use Xlw with your existing installation however 
you will probably need to rebuild the library files to avoid linking issues.

Please conatct the mailing list xlw-users@lists.sourceforge.com for more information.

\section x64 64-bit compilation

It is now possible compile 64-bit xlls using gcc from the command line.

\subsection required Required Software

A recent build of a 64-bit cross compiler from the <a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">MinGW-64</a> project.

Get the most recent package from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/" target="_blank">here</a>, you want the package named mingw-w64-bin_i686-mingw_201?????.zip

After downloading the package unpack it and copy the contents to your MinGw directory.  By default this is c:\\MinGW for method 1 above and c:\\GNU\\MinGW for method 2.

\subsection commands Building 64-bit Xlls

To build your 64 bit xlls use the following commands for debug and release.

\code
make BUILD=DEBUG PLATFORM=x64
make BUILD=RELEASE PLATFORM=x64
\endcode
