\section summary Summary

	On the Code::Blocks download site there are 2 installers available. One without MinGW and
	one with. Previously it was advised to install the one with the MinGW. However now you 
	should install the one WITHOUT MinGW, since the MinGW packaged in the Code::Blocks installer
	is the older version. 

	To setup Code::Blocks firstly install the latest MinGW as \ref a04_gcc "here".

	Then in Code::Blocks goto 'Settings->Compiler & Debugger -> Toolchain executables' and
	set the Compilers installation directory to the bin directory of your MinGW installation
	(if you used the xlw MinGW installer and installed to the default directory, this should be
	 C:\\GNU\\MinGW)
