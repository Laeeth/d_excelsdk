\section summary Summary

It is possible to override the choice of numeric matrix and array class used by the library.

\section ublas Using boost::ublas

You should simply have to uncomment the \#define USE_XLW_WITH_BOOST_UBLAS line near the top of MyContainers.h.

MyContainers.h is in the directory xlw\\include\\xlw under the install directory.

\section ublas Using Other Types

You will need to change the file MyContainers.h

The required steps are

- include the header files required by your class, below the vector include is best.
- Change the typedefs for MyArray or MyMatrix as appropriate, the ones current set to 
std::vector\<double\> and NcMatrix are the correct ones to change
- Make changes to the MatrixTraits or ArrayTraits code as required

MyContainers.h is in the directory xlw\\include\\xlw under the install directory.
