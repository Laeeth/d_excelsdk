\page a06_buildhelp Building help Files from your Xll

\section summary Summary

Xlw now includes tools to enable you to create a help file for 
your add-in quickly and easily.

In most cases building the help is as simple as running the
BuildHelp.bat located in your project directory. 

\section requiredsoftware Required Software

The following software is required

- <a href="http://sandcastle.codeplex.com/releases/view/47665#DownloadId=128770" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a>
- <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&displaylang=en" target="_blank">HTML Help Workshop</a> - get file htmlhelp.exe and install.

HTML Help Workshop needs to be installed in the default location or added to your path for the batch scripts to work correctly.

\section building Building the Help File

First build the Debug 32-bit version of your xll.

Then run the BuildHelp.bat batch file located with the project files.

The corresponding chm file should then be created.

\section additional Adding Additional Help Text

By default the help file uses the same text that is shown in the function wizard to
create a page for each function.

Often it would be helpful to add more text to a function's page.  This is possible by creating
a .maml file somewhere in the project tree.  In our examples we use a help subdirectory.

Each maml file contains additional sections that will be formatted and displayed under the
autogenerated help.

An example maml file is shown below

\code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<xlwExtraHelp id="Concat" revisionNumber="9">
  <developerHowToDocument xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <section>
      <title>More help</title>
      <content>
        <para>Some more help.</para>
      </content>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Yet More help</title>
      <content>
        <para>Even more help.</para>
        <para>And a bit more.</para>
      </content>
    </section>
  </developerHowToDocument>
</xlwExtraHelp>

\endcode

The id attribute after the xlwExtraHelp must be set to the external name of your function, in this case Concat, 
for the file to be picked up by the script.

You can have as many sections as you want in these extra help files.
