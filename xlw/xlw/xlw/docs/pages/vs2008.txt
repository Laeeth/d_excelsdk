\section summary Summary

Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2008 must be installed for all features to work correctly.

Get the service pack here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10986" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=10986</a>

Note that there is a known issue with installing SP1 and then installing the Windows SDK
where some Visual Studio headers get overridden.

Any issues with the headers should be detected during compilation. To check that you have
the latest version of the headers look at the file VC\include\yvals.h and check the define
_CPPLIB_VER is at least 505 and that there is check for _HAS_TR1 underneath.

\section workaround Working around Mismatch Headers warning

If for some reason you cannot install the SP1 then for the library to work correctly you must rebuild the library
from the sources.

First check that you have the sources, there should be an xlw\build\vc9\xlw.sln project in the XLW install
directory.  If this file is not present then reinstall XLW and select sources during the install process.

Remove or comment out the #error line in xlw\include\xlw\xlwshared_ptr.h

Load up the solution xlw\build\vc9\xlw.sln.

Open the Build\Batch Build dialog, press Select All and then press Rebuild

If you are using xlwDotNet repeat this process for the xlwDotNet\Build\VS9\xlw.Net.sln

The examples and any template projects should now work correctly.
