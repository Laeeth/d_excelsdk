    //! Wrapper for XLOPER/XLOPER12 Excel data structure
    /*!
    Class XlfOper implements a sole data member, a union of LPXLOPER and
    LPXLOPER12.  XlfOper may be initialized with a value of type LPXLFOPER
    (void*) received from Excel.  XlfOper dereferences this pointer via the
    union, depending on which version of Excel is running: The value is
    interpreted as type LPXLOPER under Excel 4, and LPXLOPER12 under Excel 12.

    The logic to dereference LPXLOPER/LPXLOPER12 is implemented in class
    XlfOperImpl and XlfOper forwards all of its calls to XlfOperImpl.

    \warning It is important \e not to add any data members or virtual
    functions to this class.  The design of xlw relies on the fact that class
    XlfOper has the same size as LPXLOPER/LPXLOPER12, this assumption allows
    values of those types received from Excel to be interpreted by the library
    as instances of XlfOper.
