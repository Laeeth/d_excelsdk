    XlfOper4 holds a pointer to the XLOPER datatype used by Excel 4.  This class
    should be used for applications which are written specifically for Excel 4.
    The compiled addin will be recognized by Excel 12, but will retain its Excel 4
    behavior, not picking up any of the enhanced functionality of Excel 12.

    The interface for this class is otherwise the same as that for class XlfOper.
