You could take a look at the TODO.txt list in the source distribution.
The latest XLW code is available through svn (more on that below).

Feel free to post to xlw-users@lists.sourceforge.net your development
ideas, contribution and sample code. To submit a patch would be the easiest
way to get quickly your contribution into the XLW source code tree.

Please subscribe the XLW mailing lists
(http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=45222), and take a look at the
XLW site (http://xlw.sf.net) and project page
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/xlw).

To keep up with the XLW development - so that your contribution will
apply to the latest source code tree

If you would like svn developer write access please get yourself a
SourceForge account/username at http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php,
then let us know your username.
You will NEED a SourceForge account if you plan to get really involved.

General SourceForge documentation is at
http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1 and you can login to your
SourceForge account at http://sourceforge.net/account/login.php

Assuming that you own the copyright of the code you will contribute we see no
problem: you just have to use the XLW license.
Anyway we may be forced to ask for a disclaimer from your employer, because
of possible conflicts of interest.
We are not really picky about legal matter, but we think you can understand our
concern: we don't want someone to step out 2 years from now claiming
copyright infringements, etc.

This is a long list of suggestion, not requirements: the XLW team can
help you on any issue, don't let details stop you.

Thank you for you interest, we look forward to your contribution
