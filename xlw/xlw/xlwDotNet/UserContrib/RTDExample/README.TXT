Q. What is an RTD Server ?

A. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/289150
   

On how to set up a basic RTD Server 
see 

  http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2008/11/13/Rtd3.aspx


To build this demo, you need to make sure that the DotNet project
references 
 Microsoft.Office.Core ( Microsoft 1x.x Object Library) found under COM in the references 
&
 Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel (Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel under .NET references )


You may need to remove my references in the project as I may have different versions to you and
 re-add your own
