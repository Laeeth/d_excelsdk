To build this demo, you need to make sure that the DotNet project
references 
 Microsoft.Office.Core ( Microsodt 1x.x Object Library) founf under COM in th references 
&
 Microsft.Office,Interop.Excel (Microsft.Office,Interop.Excel   under .NET refernces )


You may need to remove my references in the project as I may have different versions to you and
 re-add your own
