/**
MemoryPool.d - port of MemoryPool.cpp and MemoryPool.h by Laeeth Isharc
//
// Purpose:		Class definition for the memory pool class used by the
//				memory manager.  Each pool is a block of memory set
//				aside for a specific thread for use in creating temporary
//				XLOPER/XLOPER12's in the framework
//
// Purpose:     A memory pool is an array of characters that is pre-allocated,
//              and used as temporary memory by the caller. The allocation
//              algorithm is very simple. When a thread asks for some memory,
//              the index into the array moves forward by that many bytes, and
//              a pointer is returned to the previous index before the pointer
//              was advanced. When a call comes to free all of the memory, the
//              pointer is set back to the beginning of the array.
//
//              Each pool has MEMORYSIZE bytes of storage space available to it
// 
// Platform:    Microsoft Windows
//
